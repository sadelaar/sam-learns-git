##  Instruction manual

Have a look at an instruction manual that I planned, researched, designed with Adobe InDesign, organized, and wrote while pursuing a graduate certificate in technical communication:

![Writing REST API documentation: a manual for technical writers](files/Writing REST API documentation - Samuel Adelaar (2).pdf){ type=application/pdf style="width:75%;height:75vh" }

As its title suggests, the manual introduces technical writers to developing REST API documentation.

Since producing this document, I've honed my skills at writing in a plain language style. At the same time, I recognize that what's paramount in technical communication is that a document should be written in a way that's tailored to its intended audience.
