##  Instruction manual

Have a look at an instruction manual that I planned, researched, designed with Adobe InDesign, organized, and wrote while pursuing a graduate certificate in technical communication:

![Writing REST API documentation: a manual for technical writers](files/Writing REST API documentation - Samuel Adelaar (2).pdf){ type=application/pdf style="width:95%;height:65vh" }

As its title suggests, the manual introduces technical writers to developing REST API documentation.

Let me draw attention to the writing requirements I set for myself in the process of developing the manual. The goal of these requirements was to make the content easy to understand.

This content is frequently written in the second person and the imperative mood so that it’s explicitly addressed to its reader. For the sake of clarity, it is, I believe, exclusively written in the active voice and the majority of sentences are limited to one independent clause.

Looking at the manual now, I would replace some of the vocabulary I used with simpler words. At this point in my career,  I aim to write in a plain language style with terminology that my writing’s audience would be familiar with and expect. My experience at the financial institution CIBC has given me the opportunity to grow this skill.
