</ul>
<h2 id="instruction-manual">Instruction manual</h2>
<p>Have a look at an instruction manual that I planned, researched, designed with Adobe InDesign, organized, and wrote while pursuing a graduate certificate in technical communication.</p>
<p><embed alt="Writing REST API documentation: a manual for technical writers" src="../files/Writing%20REST%20API%20documentation%20-%20Samuel%20Adelaar%20%282%29.pdf" style="width:95%;height:65vh" type="application/pdf"></embed></p>
<p>As its title suggests, the manual introduces technical writers to developing REST API documentation.</p>
<p>Let me draw attention to the writing requirements I set for myself in the process of developing the manual. The goal of these requirements was to make the content easy to understand.</p>
<p>This content is frequently written in the second person and the imperative mood so that it’s explicitly addressed to its reader. For the sake of clarity, it is, I believe, exclusively written in the active voice and the majority of sentences are limited to one independent clause.</p>
<p>Looking at the manual now, I would replace some of the vocabulary I used with simpler words. At this point in my career,  I aim to write in a plain language style with terminology that my writing’s audience would be familiar with and expect. My experience at the financial institution CIBC has given me the opportunity to grow this skill.</p>
<h2 id="new-article-in-knowledge-base">New article in knowledge base</h2>
<p>Consider an article I created for a knowledge base while I was at Maximus Canada as a Knowledge base content specialist. This article's reader is a contact centre agent servicing residents of British Columbia by, for example, providing the residents with information they're looking for.</p>
<p>The article's topic is a digital ID that gives residents secure access to online government services. The article shows how to access one of the ID's features, Manage Account, and it explains what this feature allows a resident to do.</p>
<p><embed alt="Knowledge base article about government ID" src="../files/Managing%20Basic%20BCeID%20accounts.pdf" style="width:95%;height:50vh" type="application/pdf"></embed></p>
<p>The parameters that shaped how I created this article deserve a mention. In developing the article's content, I followed the official style guide and the knowledge base's informal conventions, which I identified over the course of my time with Maximus.</p>
<p>One example of these informal conventions was how the imperative mood was used. In sentences with this verb mood, the verbs' subjects were not always consistent. My article deliberately follows this convention.</p>
<p>Take note that the subject of the steps for accessing the Manage Account feature is a resident whom an agent would be helping. This grammar was chosen despite the fact that the agent would be reading this content. In the bullet points subordinate to the steps, the mood switches to indicative, a better fit with who the content's reader is.</p>
<p>As should be clear, I wrote the article so that it would be consistent with the knowledge base's other content, differing from the writing choices I would make if I was creating the content on my own.</p></div>
